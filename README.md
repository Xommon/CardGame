Interact with game through the playtest function in Unity3D with "Maximize on Play" enabled or in maximized mode.

HOW TO PLAY:
- Click the deck manager button on the main menu to select the deck you want to battle with. (game starts with default decks for player and AI)
- The user can create their own custom card in the edit a deck menu. Custom cards are added to the end of the total card list.
- Although the AI has a default deck, it will use the last deck created in the deck manager ONLY IF it exists.
- Click the play button on the deck manager to start the battle.
- Information about Pokémon abilities is displayed in the Make a Card menu, and weakness/resistance types of each type is displayed in the Create a Deck and Make a Card menus.

CARD INFO:
- Each card has a name, type, ability, and stats.
- The bottom left stat in blue is the attack stat.
- The bottom centre stat in green is the energy cost needed to play the card.
- The bottom right stat in red is the health/HP stat.

HOW TO BATTLE:
- The objective of the battle is to get your opponent's trainer health from 30 to 0.
- Players start with 3 cards and then draw a card every turn. The starting player is determined randomly.
- During your turn, click and drag the card you want to play onto your side of the field to summon it into a game piece. Make sure you have enough energy!
- Pokémon cannot attack on the turn that they are played unless their ability is "Quick", which in that case the Pokémon can attack immediately after being played.
- Click a Pokémon on your side of the field that's glowing green and click it to select it. It will start glowing yellow.
- Then click the opposing Pokémon or trainer that you want to attack. The attacking AND defending Pokémon are damaged by each other.
- It's usually a good idea to take out opposing Pokémon before going for the trainer to neutralise a growing opposing force.
- Keep note of type matchups before attacking. Information about weakness/resistance of each type is displayed in the Create a Deck and Make a Card menus.
- Keep note of ability matchups before attacking. Information about Pokémon abilities is displayed in the Make a Card menu.
- End turn once all cards are played and all attacks are made.
